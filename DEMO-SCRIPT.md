# STORM Demo Script — Gabe Newell Meeting
**Date:** January 31, 2026 | 21:00 GMT  
**Duration:** Aim for 15-20 minutes demo, leave time for discussion

---

## Pre-Demo Checklist

- [ ] Software running locally or on staging URL
- [ ] Demo vessel loaded (e.g., "M/Y STORM" or similar)
- [ ] Sample data populated (incidents, drills, crew, certificates)
- [ ] Browser in incognito (clean slate, no distractions)
- [ ] Screen sharing ready
- [ ] Backup: Screenshots/video if live demo fails

---

## Opening (2 minutes)

**Hook:** Start with the problem, not the solution.

> "Gabe, thanks for taking the time. Before I show you anything, let me paint the picture of what running a superyacht actually looks like from an operational standpoint.
>
> Every vessel I've commanded has had the same problem: fragmented systems. Maintenance logs in one place, crew certifications in another, ISM compliance in spreadsheets, safety drills tracked on paper. The captain ends up being a full-time administrator instead of focusing on what matters.
>
> STORM is my answer to that. A single platform that handles everything — built by a captain, for captains."

## Demo Flow (15 minutes)

### 1. Dashboard Overview (2 min)
**Show:** Main dashboard

**Talk through:**
- "This is the command center. At a glance, I see alerts, expiring certificates, upcoming drills, maintenance due."
- "Everything is vessel-specific — switch between vessels in a fleet instantly."
- "Alerts are actionable — click through to resolve, not just notifications."

**Key stat to mention:** "A 60m yacht typically tracks 200+ certificates, 50+ crew documents, and runs 100+ maintenance items monthly."

---

### 2. ISM/Safety Compliance (3 min)
**Show:** ISM module → Incidents → Drills → Risk Assessments

**Talk through:**
- "ISM compliance is non-negotiable. Flag state, class, insurers — everyone audits this."
- "Incident reporting with investigation workflow. Root cause analysis, corrective actions, all tracked."
- "Drill scheduling with analytics — see completion rates, identify gaps."
- "Risk assessments linked to operations. Not just paperwork — actionable safety management."

**Key insight:** "Most yachts fail ISM audits on documentation gaps. This eliminates that."

---

### 3. Crew Management (3 min)
**Show:** Crew Roster → Certificates → Training → HR

**Talk through:**
- "Every crew member's profile, documents, certifications in one place."
- "Automatic alerts for expiring STCW, medical, visas — 90, 60, 30 days out."
- "Training matrix — see who's qualified for what, identify skill gaps."
- "Leave management, hours of rest compliance (MLC), contract tracking."

**Key insight:** "A single expired ENG1 medical can ground a yacht. This prevents that."

---

### 4. Maintenance (3 min)
**Show:** Maintenance → Defects → Critical Equipment → Spare Parts

**Talk through:**
- "Planned maintenance schedules tied to running hours or calendar."
- "Defect reporting with photo upload, priority flags, assignment."
- "Critical equipment tracking — main engines, generators, thrusters — with service history."
- "Spare parts inventory with reorder alerts."

**Key insight:** "Unplanned downtime costs €50-100k/day in charter. Preventive maintenance is ROI."

---

### 5. Documents (2 min)
**Show:** Master Document Index → Document Search

**Talk through:**
- "Every document — manuals, procedures, drawings, class certificates — searchable."
- "Version control, review dates, acknowledgment tracking."
- "ISM SMS documentation integrated — not a separate system."

---

### 6. Fleet View (2 min)
**Show:** Fleet Map → Vessel switching → Fleet Groups

**Talk through:**
- "For management companies: see all vessels at once."
- "Role-based access — captains see their vessel, managers see the fleet."
- "Standardised reporting across vessels."

---

## Differentiation Slide (if needed)

| Feature | STORM | Competitors |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Built by captain | ✅ 15 years experience | ❌ Built by software devs |
| ISM-native | ✅ Compliance-first | ❌ Bolted on |
| Modern UI | ✅ 2026 tech stack | ❌ Legacy interfaces |
| Pricing | ✅ Per-vessel, simple | ❌ Complex enterprise |

---

## Closing & Ask (3 min)

> "That's STORM. One platform, all operations, built on 15 years of actually doing this job.
>
> We're at MVP stage — core functionality works, we're refining based on early feedback. Looking to onboard 5-10 vessels in Q1 for beta testing before wider launch.
>
> Given your position with Oceanco and understanding of both scale software and maritime — I'd value your perspective. And if there's alignment, I'd be interested in discussing investment or partnership."

**Pause. Let him respond.**

## Anticipated Questions & Answers

### "What's the tech stack?"
React/TypeScript frontend, Supabase (Postgres) backend, real-time sync. Modern, scalable, no legacy debt.

### "How do you handle offline/at-sea?"
PWA with offline capability planned. Sync when connectivity returns. Critical for ocean crossings.

### "What's the business model?"
SaaS — monthly per vessel. Tiered: single yacht, small fleet, management company. Simple, predictable.

### "Who's the competition?"
Helm Operations, Seakeeper, various legacy systems. Most are either outdated UI or built by people who've never run a yacht.

### "What's your unfair advantage?"
I've commanded 9 vessels. I know exactly what captains need because I've lived it. This isn't theory.

### "How much are you raising / what do you need?"
[Prepare your specific ask — investment amount, what it's for, timeline]

### "What's traction so far?"
MVP complete, [X] vessels interested for beta, targeting [X] paying customers by [date].

## Recovery Plays (If Things Go Wrong)

**Demo crashes:**
"Let me show you the architecture instead — [pull up screenshots or Figma]. The live version had a hiccup, but here's what it looks like."

**Feature doesn't work:**
"That's actually on our fix list — we identified it this week. Let me show you [adjacent feature] instead."

**He seems disengaged:**
"Gabe, I want to make sure I'm showing you what's relevant. What aspect of yacht operations are you most curious about?"

## Mindset Reminders

1. **You're not pitching — you're solving his problem.** Oceanco builds €100M+ yachts. Their clients need this.

2. **Gabe built Steam.** He understands platform thinking, network effects, user experience. Speak that language.

3. **Confidence, not arrogance.** You have 15 years of domain expertise. Own it.

4. **Listen more than you talk.** His questions reveal what he cares about. Follow those threads.

5. **It's a conversation, not a presentation.** If he interrupts with questions, that's good — he's engaged.

*Good luck, Captain. You've got this.* 🎯
